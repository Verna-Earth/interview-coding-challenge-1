# High level overview

On starting the DailyGoalsTracker the DailyGoalsTracker.Store is started with canned data which is auto-generated by the DailyGoalsTracker.Seeder.

The DailyGoalsTracker.Seeder will generate data for the eight goals defined. The data generated covers the last 90 days, with no achievements recorded for today.

The store is ephemeral and when the application is restarted a new seed will be generated for the store.

On viewing the application in the browsers you will be redirected to the achievements page where you can enter today's achievements.

The previous day and next day links can be used to navigate to a different day to fill in your achievements for that day.

**Heading navigation**

The goals link navigates you to the goals page where you can adjust your goals.

The reports link navigates to the reports page where you can view a report showing the weekly stats for the selected goal.
