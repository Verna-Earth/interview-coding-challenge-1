# ToDos

* Pagination!
* Reporting functionality - this was a very quick and dirty implementation, ideally use chart.js equiv to do some proper graphing for the weekly stuff etc.
* Find out how to get aria labels and the like into components.
* Fix last two existing tests and add more tests for records.
* Finish setting up Storybook (currently on initial generated files only) with own components
* Rewrite seeds.exs to be idempotent
* Set up consumption of .env file properly by Phoenix, or else find out how to share variable between Docker and Phoenix.
* Rename everything (possibly restart from scratch) so not stuck with ToDo naming scheme.
