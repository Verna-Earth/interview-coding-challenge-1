# ToDos

* Pagination!
* Reporting functionality - have found a method using Chart.js that looks feasible
* Finish setting up Storybook (currently on initial generated files only) with own components
* Rewrite seeds.exs to be idempotent
* Rename everything (possibly restart from scratch) so not stuck with ToDo naming scheme.
* Set up consumption of .env file properly by Phoenix, or else find out how to share variable between Docker and Phoenix.
