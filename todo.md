# ToDos

* Hide fequency input on tasks if Yes/no selected
* Validate task record dates so there's only one record per day
* Rewrite seeds.exs to be idempotent
* Rename everything (possibly restart from scratch) so not stuck with ToDo naming scheme.
* Set up consumption of .env file properly by Phoenix, or else find out how to share variable between Docker and Phoenix.
* Finish setting up Storybook (currently on initial generated files)
